# Monokai Pro

The unofficial Monokai Pro theme, adapted by [Subtheme](https://subtheme.pro). This repository includes the default theme and four filters: Machine, Octagon, Ristretto, and Spectrum. Credit goes to the original creator: [https://monokai.pro](https://monokai.pro).

This theme if functionally complete, but more work is needed to match language specific colors with the official theme (as seen in Sublime or VSCode). Focus is currently on Java and Python, but pull requests are welcome for any language.
